4.	Controller rating: OBS, S1, S2, S3, C1

5. 	Trainee: Any VATSIM member who applied for VATSIM ATC training (any rating) or is subject to training. 
<div style="padding: 10px; color: green;">
<b>Note:</b> A member who has completed a rating or endorsement but does not apply for the next rating or endorsement is no longer considered to be a trainee.
</div>

6. 	vACC: A subdivision within VATEUD. 

7. 	vACC ATD: vACC ATC Training Department. It consists of the vACC ATD lead and all vACC ATD examiners/mentors.

8. 	vACC ATD lead: vACC ATD Director and Deputy Director. At least one vACC ATD lead member must hold a minimum rating of C1. A vACC ATD lead member is also a vACC examiner.

9. 	vACC examiners: Examiners who can examine CPTs. They are appointed by the vACC ATD lead. Any vACC examiner must have been a vACC mentor before with reasonable mentoring experience for the rating which they can examine. Any vACC examiner must hold a minimum rating of S3.

`3.` Training Timeline

3.1.	**Training airports**


1. Definition: Airports at which training can take place.
2. Solo endorsements can only be issued and CPTs only be held at training airports.
3. The trainee may choose at which airport they are trained. A vACC ATD may force a trainee to be trained at a specific airport: LROP, LRTR, LRBS, LUKK.

3.2.	**OBS to S1**

1. The trainee starts with an OBS rating.
2. To start the training process, the future trainee must apply online via a web form. Once the application is completed, the trainee will be added to the training queue and notified by the vACC ATD.
3. The trainee will be informed once a mentor is assigned for the rating process.
4. Training sessions will be conducted as needed until the trainee reaches a satisfactory level of knowledge and competency for the control position. 
<div style="padding: 10px; color: green;">
<b>Note:</b> For this rating, all training sessions will be conducted on a simulator server.
</div>

5. Once the trainee is ready to control on their own, the VATEUD S1 exam will be assigned. The trainee must take the exam on their own. If passed, the trainee will be granted with the S1 rating.
6. The trainee will be added to the vACC’s controller roster once the S1 theory exam is successfully completed. Although listed on the roster, it is recommended that the mentor supervises the trainee for at least one online session as OJT.
7. With the S1 rating, the trainee is allowed to staff any unrestricted airport GND position within the vACC, provided they have successfully completed the required theoretical lesson for those positions. 
<div style="padding: 10px; color: green;">
<b>Note:</b> The theoretical session is conducted by one of the mentors appointed by the vACC ATD Lead.
</div>

3.3.	**S1 to S2**

8. A solo endorsement is valid for a maximum of 30 days. Within this period, a CPT must be held. If a CPT cannot be conducted within this timeframe, an additional 15 days of solo endorsement can be issued upon request, but only if a CPT is scheduled within those last 15 days.
9. After these 45 days, the trainee is no longer permitted to continue the solo endorsement, unless for special reasons and only if a CPT is scheduled (within the 46-60 days period).
10. If the trainee fails to complete the CPT within 60 days of the solo endorsement , the current training will be terminated, and the trainee will not be eligible to apply for the same rating for one year. After this period, the trainee must restart the training process from the beginning.
11. After the solo endorsement is validated, additional training sessions should be conducted during the active solo period to closely monitor the trainee’s progress. These sessions can be scheduled at the discretion of either the mentor or the trainee.
12. A trainee holding a SOLO endorsement must log in to the network using the designated trainee position format: ICAO_T_TWR for the respective unit.

3. The training program will consist of: one theoretical session covering general procedural control principles, two practical training sessions conducted on a simulator server, one additional theoretical lesson.
4. If, after completing these sessions, the S2 controller is still unable to effectively control procedural traffic, the vACC ATD Lead will schedule a check-up session to assess their progress.
5. The assigned mentor is responsible for issuing the validation for controlling procedural airports.
6. The mentor will continuously monitor the progress of the trained controllers to ensure competency to procedural control standards.

3.5.	**S2 to S3**



1. The trainee is required to control 50 hours on TWR positions after receiving S2 rating before continuing with this training step.

</div>

5. The vACC ATD may impose a trainee to participate in additional training sessions on APP positions before starting the C1 training. If the trainee does not sufficiently master a specific control area, they must demonstrate qualification to proceed with C1 training, which may involve random training sessions prior to beginning the C1 training.
6. The trainee will be trained up to a level where familiarisation with the designated CTR training sector becomes the primary concern. Once this level is achieved, the VATEUD C1 exam will be provided by VATEUD. The trainee must take the exam on their own.
7. Once the C1 exam is passed, a solo endorsement for the CTR sector will be issued by the mentor.
8. A solo endorsement is valid for a maximum of 30 days. Within this period, a CPT must be held. If a CPT cannot be conducted within this timeframe, an additional 15 days of solo endorsement can be issued upon request, but only if a CPT is scheduled within those last 15 days.
9. After these 45 days, the trainee is no longer permitted to continue the solo endorsement, unless for special reasons and only if a CPT is scheduled (within the 46-60 days period).
10. If the trainee fails to complete the CPT within 60 days of the solo endorsement, the current training will be terminated, and the trainee will not be eligible to apply for the same rating for one year. After this period, the trainee must restart the training process from the beginning.
