<li><p>RTP: ROvACC Training Procedure (this document)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Controller rating: OBS, S1, S2, S3, C1</p>
</li>
<li><p>Trainee: Any VATSIM member who applied for VATSIM ATC training (any rating) or is subject to training. </p>
<div style="padding: 10px; color: green;">
<b>Note:</b> A member who has completed a rating or endorsement but does not apply for the next rating or endorsement is no longer considered to be a trainee.
</div>
</li>
<li><p>vACC: A subdivision within VATEUD. </p>
</li>
<li><p>vACC ATD: vACC ATC Training Department. It consists of the vACC ATD lead and all vACC ATD examiners/mentors.</p>
</li>
<li><p>vACC ATD lead: vACC ATD Director and Deputy Director. At least one vACC ATD lead member must hold a minimum rating of C1. A vACC ATD lead member is also a vACC examiner.</p>
</li>
<li><p>vACC examiners: Examiners who can examine CPTs. They are appointed by the vACC ATD lead. Any vACC examiner must have been a vACC mentor before with reasonable mentoring experience for the rating which they can examine. Any vACC examiner must hold a minimum rating of S3.</p>
</li>
<li><p>vACC mentor: vACC ATD members who may train trainees. They are appointed by the vACC ATD lead. Any vACC mentor must hold a minimum rating of S2. The mentor must hold the rating or endorsement for which they train a trainee.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lesson: A theoretical session of a mentor with at least one trainee.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Training session: A practical training session of a mentor with one trainee. This may be online on the network or on a simulator server. Multiple trainees may observe a training.</p>
</li>
<li><p>OTS: Over the shoulder session. A training session conducted by a vACC mentor who has not previously been involved in the current training process with the respective trainee. During this session,  the mentor evaluates specific competencies to determine if the trainee is ready to proceed to the next training stage. Once the trainee passes the OTS assessment, they are granted SOLO validation or a specific endorsement.</p>
</li>
<li><p>CPT: Controller Practical Test. A practical exam. If it is passed, a new VATSIM controller rating will be granted to the examinee.</p>
</li>
<li><p>OJT: On the job training. A part of the training where the trainee provides air traffic service, while there is another mentor supervising the process.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Controller privilege: Anything which enables a VATSIM member to staff an ATC position. This includes a vACC roster entry, a tier 1 endorsement, a tier 2 endorsement or a solo endorsement.</p>

<hr>
<p><code>3.</code> Training Timeline</p>
<p>3.1.    <strong>Training airports</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Definition: Airports at which training can take place.</li>
<li>Solo endorsements can only be issued and CPTs only be held at training airports.</li>
<li>The trainee may choose at which airport they are trained. A vACC ATD may force a trainee to be trained at a specific airport: LROP, LRTR, LRBS, LUKK.</li>
</ol>
<p>3.2.    <strong>OBS to S1</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The trainee starts with an OBS rating.</li>
<li>To start the training process, the future trainee must apply online via a web form. Once the application is completed, the trainee will be added to the training queue and notified by the vACC ATD.</li>
<li>The trainee will be informed once a mentor is assigned for the rating process.</li>
<li><p>Training sessions will be conducted as needed until the trainee reaches a satisfactory level of knowledge and competency for the control position. </p>
<div style="padding: 10px; color: green;">
<b>Note:</b> For this rating, all training sessions will be conducted on a simulator server.
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Once the trainee is ready to control on their own, the VATEUD S1 exam will be assigned. The trainee must take the exam on their own. If passed, the trainee will be granted with the S1 rating.</p>
</li>
<li>The trainee will be added to the vACC&#x2019;s controller roster once the S1 theory exam is successfully completed. Although listed on the roster, it is recommended that the mentor supervises the trainee for at least one online session as OJT.</li>
<li>With the S1 rating, the trainee is allowed to staff any unrestricted airport GND position within the vACC, provided they have successfully completed the required theoretical lesson for those positions. <div style="padding: 10px; color: green;">
<b>Note:</b> The theoretical session is conducted by one of the mentors appointed by the vACC ATD Lead.
</div>

</li>
</ol>
<p>3.3.    <strong>S1 to S2</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The trainee is required to control 25 hours on the network before continuing with this training step. </li>
<li>The trainee is also required to have actively controlled in the weeks preceding their application and leading up to the start of their S2 training. </li>
<li>3.2.2. applies.</li>
<li>S2 training can only be held at a training airport.</li>
<li><p>The trainee will be trained up to a level at which familiarisation with the specific station is the primary concern. </p>
<div style="padding: 10px; color: green;">
<b>Note:</b> The initial training sessions will be conducted on a simulator server. OJT may be included as part of the training either before or after the OTS assessment.
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Once this level is achieved, the VATEUD S2 exam will be provided by VATEUD. The trainee must take the exam on their own.</p>
</li>
<li>Once the S2 exam is passed, the mentor will propose the trainee internally for an OTS session with a different mentor, as a cross-check. If the trainee passes the OTS, they will be granted a solo endorsement.</li>
<li>A solo endorsement is valid for a maximum of 30 days. Within this period, a CPT must be held. If a CPT cannot be conducted within this timeframe, an additional 15 days of solo endorsement can be issued upon request, but only if a CPT is scheduled within those last 15 days.</li>
<li>After these 45 days, the trainee is no longer permitted to continue the solo endorsement, unless for special reasons and only if a CPT is scheduled (within the 46-60 days period).</li>
<li>If the trainee fails to complete the CPT within 60 days of the solo endorsement , the current training will be terminated, and the trainee will not be eligible to apply for the same rating for one year. After this period, the trainee must restart the training process from the beginning.</li>
<li>After the solo endorsement is validated, additional training sessions should be conducted during the active solo period to closely monitor the trainee&#x2019;s progress. These sessions can be scheduled at the discretion of either the mentor or the trainee.</li>
<li>A trainee holding a SOLO endorsement must log in to the network using the designated trainee position format: ICAO_T_TWR for the respective unit.</li>
<li>The CPT must examine GND and TWR competencies.</li>
<li>The S2 rating is issued after a passed S2 CPT.</li>
</ol>
<p>3.4.    <strong>S2 - Procedural</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>An S2 rated controller must have a minimum of 10 actively controlled hours before requesting procedural control training from the vACC ATD Lead.</li>
<li>The vACC ATD Lead will assign the training to a designated mentor.</li>
<li>The training program will consist of: one theoretical session covering general procedural control principles, two practical training sessions conducted on a simulator server, one additional theoretical lesson.</li>
<li>If, after completing these sessions, the S2 controller is still unable to effectively control procedural traffic, the vACC ATD Lead will schedule a check-up session to assess their progress.</li>
<li>The assigned mentor is responsible for issuing the validation for controlling procedural airports.</li>
<li>The mentor will continuously monitor the progress of the trained controllers to ensure competency to procedural control standards.</li>
</ol>
<p>3.5.    <strong>S2 to S3</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The trainee is required to control 50 hours on TWR positions after receiving S2 rating before continuing with this training step. </p>
<div style="padding: 10px; color: green;">
<b>Note:</b> The trainee is required to obtain the S2 - Procedural endorsement before applying for this phase of training.
</div>
</li>
<li><p>The trainee is also required to have actively controlled in the weeks preceding their application and leading up to the start of their S3 training. </p>
</li>
<li>3.2.2. applies.</li>
<li>S3 training can only be held at a training airport.</li>
<li><p>The trainee will be trained up to a level at which familiarisation with the specific station is the primary concern. </p>
<div style="padding: 10px; color: green;">
<b>Note:</b> The initial training sessions will be conducted on a simulator server. OJT may be included as part of the training either before or after the OTS assessment.
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Once this level is achieved, the VATEUD S3 exam will be provided by VATEUD. The trainee must take the exam on their own.</p>
</li>
<li>Once the S3 exam is passed, the mentor will propose the trainee internally for an OTS session with a different mentor, as a cross-check. If the trainee passes the OTS, they will be granted a solo endorsement.</li>
<li>A solo endorsement is valid for a maximum of 30 days. Within this period, a CPT must be held. If a CPT cannot be conducted within this timeframe, an additional 15 days of solo endorsement can be issued upon request, but only if a CPT is scheduled within those last 15 days.</li>
<li>After these 45 days, the trainee is no longer permitted to continue the solo endorsement, unless for special reasons and only if a CPT is scheduled (within the 46-60 days period).</li>
<li>If the trainee fails to complete the CPT within 60 days of the solo endorsement , the current training will be terminated, and the trainee will not be eligible to apply for the same rating for one year. After this period, the trainee must restart the training process from the beginning.</li>
<li>After the solo endorsement is validated, additional training sessions should be conducted during the active solo period to closely monitor the trainee&#x2019;s progress. These sessions can be scheduled at the discretion of either the mentor or the trainee.</li>
<li>A trainee holding a SOLO endorsement must log in to the network using the designated trainee position format: ICAO_T_APP for the respective unit.</li>
<li>The CPT must examine APP competencies.</li>
<li>The S3 rating is issued after a passed S3 CPT.</li>
</ol>
<p>3.6.    <strong>S3 to C1</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The trainee is required to control 50 hours on APP positions after receiving S3 rating before continuing with this training step. </li>
<li>The trainee is also required to have actively controlled in the weeks preceding their application and leading up to the start of their C1 training. </li>
<li>3.2.2. applies.</li>
<li><p>C1 training can only be held in a CTR sector. The CTR training sector must provide sufficient traffic complexity to prepare a trainee to cover airports top-down and to frequently train all common separation techniques.</p>
<div style="padding: 10px; color: green;">
<b>Note:</b> The C1 training may be conducted either on a simulator server or online on VATSIM, at the discretion of the assigned mentor. Both training methods are allowed; however, online sessions on VATSIM must serve as the primary training format for this stage.
</div>
</li>
<li><p>The vACC ATD may impose a trainee to participate in additional training sessions on APP positions before starting the C1 training. If the trainee does not sufficiently master a specific control area, they must demonstrate qualification to proceed with C1 training, which may involve random training sessions prior to beginning the C1 training.</p>
</li>
<li>The trainee will be trained up to a level where familiarisation with the designated CTR training sector becomes the primary concern. Once this level is achieved, the VATEUD C1 exam will be provided by VATEUD. The trainee must take the exam on their own.</li>
<li>Once the C1 exam is passed, a solo endorsement for the CTR sector will be issued by the mentor.</li>
<li>A solo endorsement is valid for a maximum of 30 days. Within this period, a CPT must be held. If a CPT cannot be conducted within this timeframe, an additional 15 days of solo endorsement can be issued upon request, but only if a CPT is scheduled within those last 15 days.</li>
<li>After these 45 days, the trainee is no longer permitted to continue the solo endorsement, unless for special reasons and only if a CPT is scheduled (within the 46-60 days period).</li>

<div style="padding: 10px; color: green;">
<b>Note:</b> The controller will be informed about the privileges which are removed.
</div>
</li>
<li><p>If controlling privileges have been removed due to inactivity or lack of currency, the controller must follow the process to regain them, as stated below.</p>
<ol>
<li>An oral theoretical examination will be conducted before any practical session. If the oral exam is not passed, the practical session will not proceed. No more than one practical session will be required to restore any specific controlling privilege. </li>
<li>If the performance of the trainee is unsatisfactory in the practical session, the related controlling privilege shall still be issued; however, a mandatory follow-up session may be required. If the trainee continues to demonstrate an unacceptable level of competency , section 6.2 shall apply.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><code>6.</code> Competency requirements</p>

<li>If the vACC ATD lead agrees, they must inform the trainee that they are considered to be potentially underperforming. The trainee will then have two additional training sessions with approved vACC examiners to attempt to resolve the situation.</li>
<li>If the vACC examiners determine that substantial progress has been made, regular training with the trainee will continue. If the examiners conclude that the trainee&#x2019;s performance remains significantly below the expected standard at this stage and that successful completion of the training is unlikely, the examiner will inform both the vACC ATD lead and the trainee that the trainee is underperforming.</li>
<li>The vACC ATD lead will determine the duration of the training pause for the trainee is paused, not exceeding a maximum period of six months.</li>
</ol>

<li>To prevent congestion in CPT scheduling, no more than two TWR trainees under solo validation may be validated within the same calendar week.</li>
<li>A CPT may be scheduled only if both the vACC ATD Lead and the trainee mutually agree on the date.</li>
<li>The trainee must have actively controlled under a SOLO endorsement before having their CPT.</li>
