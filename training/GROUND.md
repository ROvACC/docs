## 1. Position overview

In this guide, we aim to define the role and service that the Ground controller (abbreviated as GND) has in aviation safety. If there is no Delivery control position at the respective airport, Ground is responsible for authorizing the flights as a DEL controller does.

When we talk about the GND controller, this is the one that authorizes the aircraft to move on the taxiways and platforms (or aprons). 

## 2. Push-back & Start up:

The first such movement is exiting the parking position, which is often done from behind. This means that the GND must authorize the aircraft to leave the parking position, the aircraft being pushed by a special machine, called Tug or Schof. The procedure is called **Push-back**. If this push-back can be executed in more than one way, often, the GND controller must inform the pilot about the direction in which the cockpit (the place where the pilots sit) is to be pointed after the push-back procedure is completed. For example: `facing east`

In general, the authorization to exit the parking position is done at the same time as the authorization to start the engines. This also comes with the information from the GND controller to the pilot about the local pressure (QNH) found in the latest MET report.

e.g. `push and start approved, QNH 1010`

It should be mentioned that an aircraft performing the push-back procedure will block the taxiway it leaves for an average time of 4 minutes, during which time other aircraft operating in the area should wait. For this reason, if the maneuvering surface does not allow to bypass the adjacent traffic (through other taxiways), the push-back authorization must be done correctly, on time and only if there is no other traffic behind the aircraft.

If it is not possible to authorize an airplane to leave the parking position through a push-back procedure, this must be communicated to the pilot in command.

e.g. `standby, traffic behind` or `hold position due traffic`

Also, an exit from the parking position can be conditional authorized, as in the following example: `behind Airbus A320 passing left to right, push-back start up approved, QNH 1010` or `behind propeller traffic, push-back approved, facing East, QNH 1010`

Some parking positions are specially created and defined as *self maneuvering*. This means that the pilot will receive from the GND controller the authorization to start engines on the parking position and will go taxiing towards the runway in the forward direction.

## 3. Taxi

After the push-back procedure has been completed, the pilot is ready to taxi to the runway. They receive instructions from the GND controller regarding the final point to which they are authorized to taxi, as well as the taxiways to follow between the current position and the destination position. The current taxiway often appears in the taxi clearance, and if it is missing, it is mandatory that the aircraft in the forward direction intersects with the first cleared taxiway.

In general, the pilot is not authorized to leave the yellow centerline when taxiing on the maneuvering area of an airport. Deviations from this rule are clearly specified in the SOP/LOP for each airport or by ATC.

The final point to which an aircraft is authorized to taxi is often the **holding point**, the point at where the aircraft is before the safety strip of the runway and the point at which the GND controller transfers the communication to the Tower Controller.

e.g. `taxi to holding point runway 08L via C, N`

e.g. `taxi to holding point G runway 08R via K, E, G`

In certain situations, when the traffic flow is at a higher level, it is possible to authorize progressive taxi, or to authorize hold short points during the taxi.

e.g. `taxi to holding point A runway 08R via M, hold short E` (this means the aircraft will stop before the intersection with TWY E on TWY M)

e.g. `taxi via J, K, hold short E` (this means the aircraft will stop on TWY K before the intersection with TWY E)

### Solving of potential conflicts during taxi

```1.``` **Hold position**

When used, hold position means that the aircraft shall stop immediately or as soon as possible. 

```2.``` **Hold short of**

e.g. `hold short of I` (this means the aircraft will stop before the intersection with taxiway I; the aircraft is not allowed to enter the intersection of the current taxiway with the TWY I)

Usually, this instruction is used with *give way to* (described below).

```3.``` **Give way to**

e.g. `give way to Airbus A320 coming from right to left` (the aircraft must stop and give priority to the Airbus A320 which is coming from right to left, then the aircraft can resume taxi).

## 4. Handover

Transfer of Communication must take place when:
1. The aircraft is approaching holding position.

2. When the aircraft if **conflict-free**

3. When you no longer have to give instructions to that aircraft.

If all these three points are met, then, you can say: ```CALLSIGN contact [ICAO_TWR] on [xxx.xxx]```.

## 5. Coordination

GND controller must inform TWR unit if an aircraft is taxiing to a holding point any other holding point that is not at the end of the departure runway.
