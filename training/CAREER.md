# ATC CAREER PROCEDURE

**  **

Effective: **26 JAN 2023 (AIRAC 2301)**

 
**  **
 

Approved by:  
George Enciu, vACC Director

**  **

## **1.**   **Introduction**

The purpose for this document is to regulate how users, hereinafter referred to as Student, can advance between ratings and how the members of the Training department of the Subdivision, hereinafter referred to as VATSIM Romania or ROvACC, are chosen.

This document is addressed to VATSIM users who wish to become virtual Air Traffic Control Officers within ROvACC, the subdivision of VATSIM that manage the virtual airspaces of Romania (Bucharest FIR) and Moldova (Chisinau FIR).

 

**  **

## **2.**   **General Rules**

**2.1.   **Any user of VATSIM which seeks to control within VATSIM Romania must have a minimum knowledge level of English, both written and spoken.

**2.2.   **The user who wants to become a virtual ATC in VATSIM Romania must be a local member of our vACC.

**2.3.   I**f a student fails a theoretical ATSIMTEST exam, the student must retake it as follows in the table below. If the second test fails, the student must redo the training process.

**2.4.**       If a student fails the practical examination (CPT) another one can be taken in 2 weeks from the initial one. In case of another failure, the third one will be taken in one month from the second one.

**2.5.**       The student will be assigned to a mentor based on the current availability and load of active mentors.

**2.6.**       The student and mentor will work a schedule for the training according to the student and mentor’s available time.

**2.7.**       At least one session every two weeks (14 days) is mandatory, otherwise, the student is considered inactive. \
Exception: The student must inform ATC Department when they are not available for training, when the period of time exceeds two calendar weeks.

**2.8.**       It is mandatory that between two consecutive training sessions there should be at least two days off so that the new information can be fixed.

**2.9.**	Non-participating without prior notice on the part of the Student in two training sessions results in an investigation initiated by the Training Department and after the third repetition, this can become a subject to end of the training process.

**2.10.**	From the moment a student is informed that a mentor has been assigned, the Student has 3 weeks to contact their mentor to schedule a session. If the student fails to contract their Mentor during the stated period the student's training process is cancelled.

**2.11.**	Not contacting the mentor for an absence of more than 6 weeks determines the withdrawal of the training process, and its renewal constitutes the resumption of the entire process.

**2.12.**	During the SOLO validation, the student is not allowed to control other positions for the current training rating than the assigned one. \
Exception: the students allowed to control LROP_GND (Otopeni Ground) under SOLO GND validation can also connect on LROP_DEL (Otopeni Delivery).

**2.13.	**The vACC will consider the number of planes controlled in the required controller hours when advancing to the next phase.

**2.14.**    SOLO validation will be performed by the Training Director, vACC Director or any other approved mentor that was not involved in training the student.
