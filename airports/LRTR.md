Runway operations
-----------------

Timisoara Airport has one runway 11/29. During low traffic flow operation, the preferred configuration is **RWY 11 DEP** and **RWY 29 ARR**. 

The runway is selected according to the mean direction of the wind. However, due to operational reasons, the opposite direction can be used up to a wind difference of at most 12 knots.

- Stands 01-07 and 09-14 are push-back only.
- Stand 08 is taxi-out stand.
- Stands 02-03 are used by aircraft with length < 35 m
- Stand 08 is used by aircraft with wing span greater than 36m, such as Airbus A310 or Boeing 767.
- Stands 09-14 are considered isolated stands.
- Stands 01-03 are used by domestic flights
- Stands 01-03 are mainly used by ROT, HYS, RYR
- Stands 04-06 are mainly used by DLH, AUA, WZZ
- Cargo planes shall be parked at Stand 07 or 08 (if wing span > 36 m) or 09-10
- Stands 13-14 might be used by domestic flights, if Stands 01-03 are occupied.
- TWY A, TWY B and TWY L are designated holding areas for arriving aircraft if no parking positions are available on the apron.

LVP
---
- LVP operations shall be activated when RVR is less than 550 m (horizontal visibility less than 800 m) or ceiling is below 200 ft.
- No aircraft will be holding on TWY B or C during ILS approaches on RWY 11.
- When an aircraft performing an instrument approach is at less than 4 NM on final and until landing of that aircraft, taxi clearance on the maneuvering area of other aircraft shall not be given.
- Aircraft movements on the apron must be carried out with the direction of a “FOLLOW ME” car

Traffic regulation
------------------
- VFR circuits shall be cleared to execute traffic pattern at the NE of the airport, due to high density population in the SW of the airport. 
- VFR traffic might be allowed to climb in TMA ARAD, only with a pre-coordinated TWR-APP approval.
- In general, traffic pattern is executed at 1000 ft AGL (by QFE) or 1400 ft AMSL (by QNH).
- On request, TWR shall be able to issue clearances on reported QFE pressure.
