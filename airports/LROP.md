LROP - Otopeni Henri Coandă International Airport
=================================================

General
-------

Bucharest Henri Coandă - Otopeni Airport is located at about 7 miles
north of Bucharest, the capital of Romania, it is the main international
airport in Romania. It has become the busiest airport since Baneasa
Aurel Vlaicu Airport (LRBS) was converted into a general aviation
airport and all low cost operations were moved to Otopeni. Traffic
consists of medium aircraft (mostly from A320 and B737 families) with
seldom heavy arrivals.

Area of Responsability
----------------------

DEL is responsible for approving Flight Plans and reading clearances.

GND is responsible for control of air traffic on the aprons and
taxiways, such as start-ups, pushbacks and taxi.

TWR is responsible for air traffic service on the runways and in Otopeni
Control Zone for VFR traffic which fly in it. Otopeni CTR is classified
as Class C airspace, both IFR and VFR are allowed to enter.

APP is responsible for air traffic service in TMA Bucharest, classified
as Class A airspace, where only IFR flights are allowed to enter.

ATIS
----

TWR is responsible for updating and maintaining Otopeni ATIS. Also GND
is allowed to connect ATIS, when TWR is not online.

Runway operations
-----------------

The airport has two runways: Runway No. 1 (08R/26L) and Runway No. 2
(08L/26R).

For operational purposes (short taxiing distance from apron to runway
and heavy amount of traffic from the west part of the airport) it is
preferred to use direction 08. Thus, if the wind does not exceed 6-7
kts, favorable for direction 26, direction 08 is kept in use.

Aircraft with code higher than aerodrome code 4D (wingspan greater than
52m and outer main gear wheel span OMGWS greater than 9m) shall vacate
RWY 08R via TWY D, otherwise, shall wait for towing and will shut down
engines 1 and 4. If aircraft code is less than 4D, pilot may decide to
do backtrack using turn pad 26L and vacate runway via TWY D.

Operational use of intersection take-offs: all jet aircraft must use the
full runway length available for noise abatement reasons. Take-offs from
intersection with taxiway may be allowed at ATC discretion (for
operational reasons) or pilot request. TWY V and TWY W are exit only
taxiways. From TWY W and TWY V is not allowed to take-off.

In general, RWY 08L/R are both used for departures and arrivals. 26L
shall be used for arrivals and 26R for depatures.

Taxi
----

The aircraft is cleared to taxi from GND. GND handoffs to TWR when the
aircraft approaches the holding point. It is drawn before the runway
entry with a yellow line, perpendicular to the taxiway axis.

Taxiing of aircraft with wingspan greater than 52 m is not allowed on
TWY C.

During LVP, ATC shall instruct pilots to follow the Follow Me car.

TWY W and TWY V are used only for vacating runway. Do not instruct
aircrafts to enter runway via TWY V or TWY W.

LVP
---

RWY 08R is authorized for CAT IIIA operations (RVR not less than 200 m)
and guided take-off. RWY 08R is the main runway used during LVP.

RWY 08L is authorized for CAT II operations (RVR not less than 350 m)
and guided take-off.

RWY 26L/R are authorized for CAT I operations and LVTO.

If available visual aids do not provide sufficient taxi information,
pilots may ask for Follow-me car guidence.

Traffic regulation
------------------

In real life, LROP airport is closed for VFR traffic.

On VATSIM, VFR traffic is permitted to fly at LROP.

VFR aircrafts shall request clearance from DEL. The maximum cleared
altitude which a VFR could climb in CTR Otopeni is 1500 ft (AMSL) by
QNH, to maintain the minimum vertical separation between aircrafts in
(minimum descend at 2500 ft by QNH) and below TMA.

Traffic pattern is allowed only in the North side of the airport and
performed only on runway no. 2 (08L / 26R).

In the South of Bucharest Henri Coanda Airport, there is LRTRA4 area,
restricted area activated by ATC from the ground until 1017 ft AMSL. If
it is active, arrival traffic at runway no. 1 (08R/26L) will not be
affected.

TWR Unit shall control VFR traffic which fly in CTR Otopeni. Below, you
can read the chart used by VFR pilots around Otopeni Airport in CTR
Otopeni and CTR Baneasa.

In CTR Otopeni, ATC expects pilots to know the class of airspace, VFR
reporting points and runway crossing routes. OGUPI-RIRUX is used only by
state aircrafts (SMURD, MAE, MAI, SRI - helicopters). SORUR-ROTBI and
GOTOB-UNUSU are available only at 1000 ft AMSL (by QNH).
