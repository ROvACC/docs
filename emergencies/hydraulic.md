## Hydraulic problems

### May result in

- fuel dumping

- gear and brake problems

- relatively high speed

- approach and landing

### Expect

- limited manoeuvrability

- limited flap and bank angle

- manual gear extension (no retraction possible)

- holding pattern for necessary checks

- extended final

- higher approach speed on final (up to 220 KIAS on flapless approach)

- limited breaking capability

- possible overrun

- RWY blocked after landing

### Remember

**A** 'Acknowledge' - **S** 'Separate' - **S** 'Silence' - **I** 'Inform' - **S** 'Support - **T** 'Time'

- increase vertical and lateral separation

- ask if dangerous goods on board

- ask for number of POB

- avoid ATC-caused GO AROUND

- clear RWY according to local procedures and instructions

- keep safety strip clear

### If needed, inform pilot aboutÔÉÅ

- next suitable airport

- airport details as soon as possible

- weather information of landing aerodrome

- fire or smoke from brakes
