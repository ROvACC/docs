## [Guide] How to install sector files?

Every 28 days, on Thursday, there is the AIRAC update, where all the changes made throughout the month are published. Controllers are requested to update their sector files to the latest version.

### Install

Install Pack is mandatory to install the first time. 

* Go to [this page](https://files.aero-nav.com/LRBB) and download the Install Pack available.
* To keep track of the cycle you installed, create a folder in ```Documents/EuroScope/``` with the name ```LRBB GNG XXXX``` in which you will unzip the Install Pack. Keep in mind, ```XXXX``` is the current AIRAC cycle. You can see the current cycle [here](http://files.aero-nav.com/LRBB) in the AIRAC column of the table.

### Update

If you control using your own sector changes, there is the method to use the Update pack which has only the essential changes in addition. However, it is recommended to always use the Install Pack to avoid errors.

* Go to [this page](https://files.aero-nav.com/LRBB) and download the Install Pack available.
* Unzip the archive in the folder where you have the previous version. This folder should be in ```Documents/EuroScope/LRBB GNG XXXX```.
