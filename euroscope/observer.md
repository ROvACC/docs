## [Guide] How to connect as observer?

As per [VATSIM Code of Conduct](https://vatsim.net/docs/policy/code-of-conduct), users can connect as observers using their abbreviated name, followed by the **_OBS** suffix.

For example, if your name is Joe Doe, your observer call sign is JD_OBS. However, it is possible that this name is already connected online; To resolve the conflict, use a third letter, representing either your middle name or one of the second letters of your first or last name, such as: JOD_OBS or JDO_OBS. Never connect using ICAO codes of some airports or with special call signs designated for VATSIM staff members.

See an example in the image below:

Do not forget to delete all ATIS lines because those lines are defined for the last set control position.
