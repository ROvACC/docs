The runway visual range is reported in meters throughout periods when either the visibility or the runway visual range is less than 1 500 m.<br><br>When the variation of the runway visual range values shows an upward or downward tendency, this is indicated by the abbreviation “U” or “D”, respectively. When actual fluctuations during the 10-minute period show no distinct tendency, this is indicated using the abbreviation “N”. Human observer can't assess and reported RVR. | R08/0400N  <br>R27/0250  <br>R26/0900D  <br>R26/1400  <br>R09/M0050  <br>R26/P2000N R27/1200U |
