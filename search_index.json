JAN 2023 (AIRAC 2301)\n\nApproved by:George Enciu, vACC Director\n\n1.   Introduction\nThe purpose for this document is to regulate how users, hereinafter referred to as Student, can advance between ratings and how the members of the Training department of the Subdivision, hereinafter referred to as VATSIM Romania or ROvACC, are chosen.\nThis document is addressed to VATSIM users who wish to become virtual Air Traffic Control Officers within ROvACC, the subdivision of VATSIM that manage the virtual airspaces of Romania (Bucharest FIR) and Moldova (Chisinau FIR).\n\n2.   General Rules\n2.1.   Any user of VATSIM which seeks to control within VATSIM Romania must have a minimum knowledge level of English, both written and spoken.\n2.2.   The user who wants to become a virtual ATC in VATSIM Romania must be a local member of our vACC.\n2.3.   If a student fails a theoretical ATSIMTEST exam, the student must retake it as follows in the table below. If the second test fails, the student must redo the training process.\n\n  \n   Rating\n   \n   2nd attempt\n   \n  \n  \n   S1\n   \n   1 week\n   \n  \n  \n   S2\n   \n   2 weeks\n   \n  \n  \n   S3\n   \n   3 weeks\n   \n  \n  \n   C1\n   \n   1 month\n   \n  \n\n\n\n2.4.       If a student fails the practical examination (CPT) another one can be taken in 2 weeks from the initial one. In case of another failure, the third one will be taken in one month from the second one.\n2.5.       The student will be assigned to a mentor based on the current availability and load of active mentors.\n2.6.       The student and mentor will work a schedule for the training according to the student and mentor’s available time.\n2.7.       At least one session every two weeks (14 days) is mandatory, otherwise, the student is considered inactive. \\\nException: The student must inform ATC Department when they are not available for training, when the period of time exceeds two calendar weeks.\n2.8.       It is mandatory that between two consecutive training sessions there should be at least two days off so that the new information can be fixed.\n2.9.    Non-participating without prior notice on the part of the Student in two training sessions results in an investigation initiated by the Training Department and after the third repetition, this can become a subject to end of the training process.\n2.10.    From the moment a student is informed that a mentor has been assigned, the Student has 3 weeks to contact their mentor to schedule a session. If the student fails to contract their Mentor during the stated period the student's training process is cancelled.\n2.11.    Not contacting the mentor for an absence of more than 6 weeks determines the withdrawal of the training process, and its renewal constitutes the resumption of the entire process.\n2.12.    During the SOLO validation, the student is not allowed to control other positions for the current training rating than the assigned one. \\\nException: the students allowed to control LROP_GND (Otopeni Ground) under SOLO GND validation can also connect on LROP_DEL (Otopeni Delivery).\n2.13.    The vACC will consider the number of planes controlled in the required controller hours when advancing to the next phase.\n2.14.    SOLO validation will be performed by the Training Director, vACC Director or any other approved mentor that was not involved in training the student.\n\n3.   Training Timeline\n3.1.       Tower Trainee (S1) – Delivery / Ground Controller\n3.1.1.   The student must complete a minimum of 6 Sweatbox sessions in order to be allowed to request the S1 ATSIMTEST theoretical exam.\n3.1.2.   After the student passes the S1 ATSIMTEST and receives the S1 rating, the mentor is allowed to issue a SOLO DEL validation for Delivery position.\n3.1.3.   The student must complete at least 5 useful hours as SOLO DEL online before connecting online under Mentor’s supervision on Ground position.\n3.1.4.   The student must pass the solo validation in order to be granted SOLO GND status in ROvACC.\n3.1.5.   The SOLO GND status is valid for 90 days.\n3.1.6. The average training time is 4 weeks.\n3.2.       Tower Controller (S2)\n3.2.1.   Any S1 member needs to complete at least 25 hours during a period of at least 14 days after receiving the SOLO GND status in order to request to move to the next training phase and request S2 ATSIMTEST.\n3.2.2.   After the student passes the S2 ATSIMTEST, a mentor is allowed to start the theoretical and practical training with the student. They are required to complete at least 6 Sweatbox sessions before the mentor is allowed to connect with the student online under the supervision of the Mentor.\n3.2.3.   The student must pass the solo validation in order to be granted SOLO TWR status in ROvACC.\n3.2.4.   The SOLO TWR status is valid for 90 days.\n3.2.5.   The student must complete at least 50 hours during a period of at least 21 days after achieving SOLO TWR in order to request the Controller Practical test (S2 CPT).\n3.2.6.   In order to control any other control positions allowed by the current rating, the controller should complete at least one theoretical session in order to connect on the position. (see table at paragraph 6.)\n3.2.7. The average training time is 4 weeks.\n3.3.       Radar Controller (S3) – Approach / Departure Controller\n3.3.1.   Any S2 member needs to complete at least 75 hours of VATSIM control during a period of 30 days in order to request to move to the S3 training phase and request the S3 ATSIMTEST.\n3.3.2.   After the student passes the S3 ATSIMTEST, a mentor is allowed to start the theoretical and practical training with the student. They are required to complete at least 6 Sweatbox sessions before the mentor is allowed to connect with the student online under the supervision of the Mentor.\n3.3.3.   The student must pass the solo validation in order to be granted SOLO APP status in ROvACC.\n3.3.4.   The SOLO APP status is valid for 90 days.\n3.3.5.

Position overview\nThe Delivery position is the first ATC position that a pilot usually interacts with when preparing to fly. Some airports do not have a dedicated position for Delivery, its work being delegated to the Ground or Tower controller. \nIn the airspace of Romania, the only such position is at Henri Coanda International Airport, Bucharest - Otopeni. Although this training is specifically written for the Delivery control position, all this theory can also be used for the Ground or Tower control position, where there is no Delivery or Ground.\nThe main objective of the Delivery position is to issue Departure Clearances. These are used to give instructions to the pilots immediately after take-off until they reach the en-route system.\nThe Delivery controller (DEL) is the one who verifies the Flight Plan (FPL) - a document that the pilot files with VATSIM so ATC knows where the pilot intends to navigate their aircraft.\n\n\n\nLogin Call Sign\nCall sign\nFrequency\nID\n\n\n\n\nLROP_DEL\nOtopeni Clearance Delivery\n121.955\nDOP\n\n\n\n2. IFR Clearance\nClearance is the authorization by which the pilot is informed about the point to which the plane is authorised to fly, the runway for take-off, the route they will follow until the route system, the level or altitude at which they will initially or finally climb and a squawk code.\n2.1. Clearance limit\nClearance limit indicates the waypoint or airport to which the pilot is authorised to fly. It is important to mention that this limit is imposed by the type of flight plan that is submitted, specifically the Flight Rules field. Flight Rules is the field that indicates how the pilot will navigate their aircraft: either using the instruments (IFR - Instrument Flight Rules), or using landmarks, rivers, cities in sight, i.e. visually, with the terrain in sight throughout the flight (VFR - Visual Flight Rules), or a combination of the two.\nA Flight Plan can be submitted as IFR, but during the flight the pilot can decide to change the type of flight to VFR, in this case speaking of a Y Flight Plan. A YFR flight behaves like an IFR flight up to the point that delimits the IFR flight from the VFR flight. The second way in which a FPL can be filled is VFR, taking off from an airfield and after a period of time the Flight Rules change to IFR. This type of FPL is called a Z Flight Plan. So, a ZFR flight is a flight that takes off as VFR and ends its flight as IFR.\nWhy is it important?\nFlight Rules determine what the Clearance limit is. In the case of IFR the aircraft is authorised to the final destination, while in the case of YFR the aircraft is authorised to the last point where the aircraft flies IFR.\nIn phraseology, this limit clearance is authorised using the following phrases:\nThe aircraft is flying IFR:\nCLEARED TO CLUJ\nThe aircraft is flying IFR to BUKEL then VFR, so it’s YFR:\nCLEARED TO BUKEL\n2.2. Departure Procedure (SID)\nDeparture Procedure is a standard procedure that connects the runway to the en-route system, where the planes fly or climb towards the cruise phase. These routes are called SID (Standard Instrument Departure). These routes are the most common ways by which an aircraft can receive permission to fly in the terminal area or immediately after departure.\nTipically, a SID has as its last point the first point in the flight plan.\nSIDs are of two types: RNAV (area navigation) and standard. The difference between the two types is the way in which it is navigated: if in the first case, RNAV, we are talking about GPS navigation, with clearly established points that the aircraft follow in flight, in standard navigation, stations located on the ground, called navigation aids, are used through which the aircraft (and its systems) must identify at what distance it is from a certain aid and in which direction to fly in order to intercept certain predefined directions in the standard SID procedures.\nAs a conclusion, the major difference between the RNAV SID compared to the standard SID is the accuracy of the positioning of the aircraft in flight. That is why RNAV SID procedures are preferred in Romanian airspace where they exist. If RNAV SID are not available at an airport (such as LRCK), then standard procedures are used. \nHowever, there is an exception: in TMA Bucharest (LROP, LRBS) the standard procedures are suspended, so that aircraft that are not approved to fly RNAV cannot be authorised to fly standard SID. In such cases, we arrive at the second way in which a flight can be authorised to fly to the en-route system, namely using \"vectors for departure\".\nIn phraseology, this SID is attached to the take-off runway, if that SID is not uniquely used from a single runway.\nThe aircraft will take off from Otopeni from runway 08L via SOKRU1K SID:\nSOKRU1K DEPARTURE RUNWAY 08L\nThe aircraft will take off from Cluj from runway 25 via IRLOX1M:\nIRLOX1M DEPARTURE\nNote: because LROP SID SOKRU1K is a SID from both 08L and 08R, naming the runway is mandatory; but in Cluj, IRLOX1M is a procedure used only from runway 25, which means that the explicit read is not mandatory, but it is recommended.\n2.3. Vectors\nAs mentioned before, an aircraft that cannot fly RNAV in areas where there are no standard procedures or they are suspended will receive \"vectors for departure\" clearance. However, there could be other reasons why an aircraft could be authorised in this way, for example, aircraft that do not intend to join the en-route system, that fly local or that make training flights, i.e. those that will fly local and they will land or practice approach procedures to the runway in service.\nIf the DEL controller does not find a suitable SID for the flight (according to the Flight Plan), they must coordinate instructions with the APP or ACC unit above.\nLROP_DEL: Approach, Otopeni Delivery\nLROP_APP: Go ahead\nLROP_DEL: ROT123, request vectors for departure for IFR to Baneasa.\nLROP_APP: Released, on runway heading, climb 4000 ft\nNotes: since the aircraft takes off from Otopeni and flies to Baneasa, an airport located in the same TMA and at a very short distance, a SID cannot be assigned. In this case, the DEL controller coordinates with LROP_APP (Bucharest Approach) the departure instructions which, later, the DEL controller will include in the clearance of the aircraft.\nIf the APP or ACC unit is not online, this coordination will not take place, and the pilot will receive instructions from the DEL Controller as follows:\nAFTER DEPARTURE, FLY AT OWN DISCRETION\n2.4. Initial Climb Clearance\nInitial Climb Clearance is the altitude (measured in feet) or flight level (measured in hundreds of feet) to which the aircraft is authorised to climb. As a general rule, according to the semicircular flight rule in Romania and Moldova, aircraft flying westbound will fly at an EVEN level, and those flying eastbound will fly at an ODD level, unless other procedures are in place.\nThe maximum authorised level that a Controller lower in position than ACC can authorise is FL280 (westbound) and FL270 (eastbound).\nAs a general rule, for separation, two planes flying on the same SID and taking off one after the other will receive a different flight level clearance: the first will receive a maximum of FL280 (westbound) and FL270 (eastbound), if no other local procedures exist, and the second plane will be cleared to climb 2000 ft lower than the first. This rule is applied for each individual SID, i.e. for each traffic flow.\nA practical example: flights from LROP via SOKRU and via BUKEL. The first plane flying to SOKRU climbs to FL280, the second plane flying to SOKRU climbs to FL260, the third plane flying to SOKRU climbs to FL240 and so on. After that, the first plane flying towards BUKEL (being another flow) will climb to FL280, the second towards BUKEL will climb to FL260 and so on. \nAn aircraft might have the final requested level less than FL280 or FL270. This means, you will not clear the traffic to climb further than requested in the Flight Plan.\nAn already used flight level becomes available when the aircraft to which that level was assigned no longer appears in the Departure List, i.e. it has departed.\nIt should be noted that during the initial climb authorization (at clearance), the flight level or the altitude to which the pilot is cleared to climb must not exceed the flight level or the altitude that the pilot intends to maintain during the cruise phase of the flight.\nIn phraseology, there are two phrases used to authorize an aircraft to climb to a certain altitude or flight level.\nThe first, when there are no speed or altitude restrictions between two points on that SID:\nCLIMB FL280\nAnd the second, when there is at least one speed or altitude restriction in the SID:\nCLIMB VIA SID FL280\n2.5. Transponder Code\nThe transponder is a device installed in the plane used to identify the aircraft and correlate the target with the flight plan. What you need to know about the transponder is that aircraft are required to use it in controlled airspace and that it can be operated in 3 modes.\nFunctionality of the transponder: the pilot of the aircraft set a code in the transponder, a code that is transmitted to the radar, the radar identifies a position from where a signal is emitted and is transmitted to the CWP (controller work position), where ATC is tasked with identifying the aircraft that displays a certain code and link or correlate the target on the screen with the flight plan related to that aircraft. As a DEL controller, your job is not to identify the aircraft on the radar because you work in a non-radar environment, but only to instruct the pilot to set a certain transponder code.\nThere are 4 operating modes of the transponder:\n\nSTBY (stand-by): transponder is off; no signal is send to the radar\nModeA: only the current position is send to the radar\nModeC: the current position and altitude is send to the radar\nModeS: is the most complex mode, because in addition to ModeC's transmission capability, ModeS can also transmit other data about the aircraft, such as indicated air speed, mach number or fuel on board.\n Note: In addition to the previously mentioned, a ModeS transponder has the ability to automatically correlate the target with the FPL, which means that it is not necessary to use an unique code compared to other aircraft. Thus, capable aircraft will be assigned squawk code 1000.\n\n\nIn Romanian airspace, aircraft flying in controlled airspace are required to use a ModeC transponder and use it in ON mode the entire time the aircraft is moving, whether on the apron, taxiway, runway or in the air.\nIn phraseology, the allocation of the squawk code is done using the following phrase:\nSQUAWK 2710 (squawk two seven one zero)\nSQUAWK 1000 (squawk one thousand)\nNote: squawk codes are codes of 4-digits in base-8. This means that each digit is 0...7 inclusive.\nNote: the code is automatically given by EuroScope for IFR flights after pressing the mouse left button in the ASSR column, and for VFR flights, 67xx codes are set manually.\n2.6. VFR Clearance\n1. VFR traffic pattern\nVFR traffic pattern is the flight that is performed around a runway, being the simplest training for new pilots, but also a maintenance exercise for old pilots, consisting of a \"rectangle\" around the runway, through which the pilot practices take-off, four 90 degree turns on the same side (named hands) and a landing.\nFor this type of flight, ATC DEL is responsible to transmit to the pilot the runway from which they will take off and execute the traffic pattern, the direction they will turn (left or right), the altitude to climb to, as well as a squawk code.\n2. Cross country flight\nA cross-country flight means that an aircraft takes off from point A and lands at point B. Most of the time, such a flight crosses several controlled airspaces where there are reporting points. If the flight takes off from a controlled airspace, ATC DEL shall clear the aircraft to exit the controlled airspace or the control zone of the departure aerodrome via a designated waypoint.\n3. Work with EuroScope\n\nDeparture List is the most representative list that the DEL Controller uses because it contains all the necessary information for ATC DEL to be able to read the clearance.\nLet’s decode the list columns:\n\n\n\nColumn\nMeaning\nLeft click\nRight click\n\n\n\n\nDS\ndeparture stand\nopen stand menu\n-\n\n\nk\nclearance checkbox\nset clearance received flag\nopen PDC window\n\n\nFR\nflight rules\n-\n-\n\n\nC/S\ncall sign\nopen handoff popup menu\ntoggle route draw\n\n\nRWY\ndeparture runway\nopen RWY setup popup list\n-\n\n\nSID\nstandard instrument departure identificator\nopen SID setup popup list\n-\n\n\nCFL\ncleared flight level\nopen temporary altitude popup list\n-\n\n\nTYPE\naircraft type (ICAO code), followed by the wake category letter\n-\n-\n\n\nT\ntransponder capability: A stands for ModeA/C, S stands for ModeS\n-\n-\n\n\nASSR\nassigned squawk code\nauto assign squawk\nopen SQUAWK popup list\n\n\nADEP\ndeparture aerodrome (ICAO code)\nopen FPL dialog box\n-\n\n\nADES\ndestination airport (ICAO code)\n-\n-\n\n\nRFL\nrequested or final level in the cruise phase of the flight\nOpen final altitude popup list\n-\n\n\nC\ntype of communication (/v - voice only, /r - the pilot can receive voice, but will reply via text, /t - text only)\nopen communication type popup\n-\n\n\nACST\naircraft status (or ground status)\nopen ground state menu\n-\n\n\n\n4.

DCL (Departure Clearance)\n5.1. How to connect to DCL?\nFirst of all you need a Hoopie token. In order to get a token you should request one here on Hoppie page. Follow the steps on the page before proceeding further.\n5.2. Login in TopSky\n\nTopSky Menu >> Setup >> CPDLC Setting...\nLogin code is a 4 letter based code. If you are connecting DCL/PDC only, the logon code should be the ICAO designator code of the airport you are controlling.\nFor example, if you are connecting DCL at Otopeni, the code should be LROP.\nLogon code is your Hoppie token. \nMake sure that the DCL/PDC check box has true value. In the image above, all check boxes are set to true.\nTo connect you should press the Connect button. The Connect button is available in the menu, only when you are online, connected on VATSIM.\nNote: This function shall be used only when the controller is online on VATSIM. This function shall not be used or tested while connected on any Sweatbox servers.\n5.3. Extra list for free text messages\nIf a pilot decide to send a DCL request with an additional message, you, as controller are able to see it in the CPDLC Current Message Window. To activate it, in the TopSky menu >> Tools >> CPDLC >>  Current Messages...\nIn general, this kind of extra messages are put by the pilot as a greeting or as a special request when filling the DCL.\n5.4. DCL request in Departure List\nA DCL request will appear as an R in the k column of the departure list. If the R is read, this means that the pilot put an additional text in the DCL request. You can read this additional message in the CPDLC Current Message Window.\nTo send the DCL, right click on the R and check the data. If correct, you can send by clicking on the Send DCL button.\nAfter the pilot is replying, the clearance checkbox is automatically set to true.\n"},"training/GROUND.html":{"url":"training/GROUND.html","title":"S1 - Ground","keywords":"","body":"GROUND CONTROLLER\n\nApproved by George Enciu, vACC Director\n\nCreated by Teodor G Petrică, OPS\n\n1. Position overview\nIn this guide, we aim to define the role and service that the Ground controller (abbreviated as GND) has in aviation safety. If there is no Delivery control position at the respective airport, Ground is responsible for authorizing the flights as a DEL controller does.\nWhen we talk about the GND controller, this is the one that authorizes the aircraft to move on the taxiways and platforms (or aprons). \n2. Push-back & Start up:\nThe first such movement is exiting the parking position, which is often done from behind. This means that the GND must authorize the aircraft to leave the parking position, the aircraft being pushed by a special machine, called Tug or Schof. The procedure is called Push-back. If this push-back can be executed in more than one way, often, the GND controller must inform the pilot about the direction in which the cockpit (the place where the pilots sit) is to be pointed after the push-back procedure is completed. For example: facing east\nIn general, the authorization to exit the parking position is done at the same time as the authorization to start the engines. This also comes with the information from the GND controller to the pilot about the local pressure (QNH) found in the latest MET report.\ne.g. push and start approved, QNH 1010\nIt should be mentioned that an aircraft performing the push-back procedure will block the taxiway it leaves for an average time of 4 minutes, during which time other aircraft operating in the area should wait. For this reason, if the maneuvering surface does not allow to bypass the adjacent traffic (through other taxiways), the push-back authorization must be done correctly, on time and only if there is no other traffic behind the aircraft.\nIf it is not possible to authorize an airplane to leave the parking position through a push-back procedure, this must be communicated to the pilot in command.\ne.g. standby, traffic behind or hold position due traffic\nAlso, an exit from the parking position can be conditional authorized, as in the following example: behind Airbus A320 passing left to right, push-back start up approved, QNH 1010 or behind propeller traffic, push-back approved, facing East, QNH 1010\nSome parking positions are specially created and defined as self maneuvering. This means that the pilot will receive from the GND controller the authorization to start engines on the parking position and will go taxiing towards the runway in the forward direction.\n3. Taxi\nAfter the push-back procedure has been completed, the pilot is ready to taxi to the runway. They receive instructions from the GND controller regarding the final point to which they are authorized to taxi, as well as the taxiways to follow between the current position and the destination position. The current taxiway often appears in the taxi clearance, and if it is missing, it is mandatory that the aircraft in the forward direction intersects with the first cleared taxiway.\nIn general, the pilot is not authorized to leave the yellow centerline when taxiing on the maneuvering area of an airport. Deviations from this rule are clearly specified in the SOP/LOP for each airport or by ATC.\nThe final point to which an aircraft is authorized to taxi is often the holding point, the point at where the aircraft is before the safety strip of the runway and the point at which the GND controller transfers the communication to the Tower Controller.\ne.g. taxi to holding point runway 08L via C, N\ne.g. taxi to holding point G runway 08R via K, E, G\nIn certain situations, when the traffic flow is at a higher level, it is possible to authorize progressive taxi, or to authorize hold short points during the taxi.\ne.g. taxi to holding point A runway 08R via M, hold short E (this means the aircraft will stop before the intersection with TWY E on TWY M)\ne.g. taxi via J, K, hold short E (this means the aircraft will stop on TWY K before the intersection with TWY E)\n\nSolving of potential conflicts during taxi\n1. Hold position\nWhen used, hold position means that the aircraft shall stop immediately or as soon as possible. \n2. Hold short of\ne.g. hold short of I (this means the aircraft will stop before the intersection with taxiway I; the aircraft is not allowed to enter the intersection of the current taxiway with the TWY I)\nUsually, this instruction is used with give way to (described below).\n3. Give way to\ne.g. give way to Airbus A320 coming from right to left (the aircraft must stop and give priority to the Airbus A320 which is coming from right to left, then the aircraft can resume taxi).\n4. Handover\nTransfer of Communication must take place when:\n\nThe aircraft is approaching holding position.\n\nWhen the aircraft if conflict-free\n\nWhen you no longer have to give instructions to that aircraft.\n\n\nIf all these three points are met, then, you can say: CALLSIGN contact [ICAO_TWR] on [xxx.xxx].\n5. Coordination\nGND controller must inform TWR unit if an aircraft is taxiing to a holding point any other holding point that is not at the end of the departure runway.\n"},"training/STUDENT_2.html":{"url":"training/STUDENT_2.html","title":"S2 - Tower Controller","keywords":"","body":"TOWER CONTROLLER (STUDENT 2)\nPosition Overview\nTower is responsible for all take-offs and landings and gives\ninstructions to effect proper sequencing and separation of aircraft for\ndeparture. Tower decides which runways are being used for take-offs and\nlandings depending on wind direction etc. You are also responsible for\naircraft on the ground when they are on the runway or are about to cross\na runway. Landing aircraft are handed over to Ground as soon as they\nleave the runway (or sooner at tower’s discretion) Departing aircraft\nare handed over to the next controller when they leave your airspace.\nOtopeni Tower is responsible for all aircraft and ground vehicles\nmovements on the runways. The main objective of a Tower controller is to\nensure a safe departure and arrival for aircraft and also to get\naircraft on time and to make sure he helps at economy of the airlines.\nLocal authority has allocated two frequencies for Otopeni Tower. The\nmain one is using the callsign LROP_S_TWR and transmitting on the\nfrequency 120.900, and the second one is using the callsign LROP_N_TWR\nand transmitting on the frequency 121.850. For both positions the radio\ncallsign is the same: “Otopeni Tower”. The majority of the time only the\nmain frequency is opened (LROP_S_TWR) which control both runways on\nOtopeni airport. If LROP_N_TWR is online, it controls the north runway\n(08L/26R) and LROP_S_TWR will maintain control of the south runway\n(08R/26L). It is easy to remember the ownership of the positions because\nof callsign designators which are “S” from south and “N” from north.\nWhen you come online as Tower on VATSIM you have to select the active\nrunways from the “Active airport/runway selector dialog” in Euroscope.\nThe selection of active runways is depending by wind conditions\n(aircraft should always arrive and depart with a headwind), by NOTAM and\nalso by the expecting traffic. The preferred runways at LROP are 08L and\n08R which are both equipped with CAT III ILS approach in case of LVP and\nalso ensure a short taxi route for departing aircraft, and a short\napproach for aircraft which comes from west (the majority of them). So\nwhen the wind is calm and also even if there is a light wind favorable\nfor runway 26L/R (till 6-7kt) it is preferred to use runways 08L/R as\nactive. Regarding Euroscope’s tools you only have to select “DEPART”\nstatus in departure list just after you give takeoff clearance to an\naircraft. Also, as tower, you have to connect the Euroscope ATIS.\nYou should not forget about coordination with Approach before takeoff.\nIf the aircraft has already contacted you and you haven't coordinated\nwith the approach controller you must ask the aircraft to hold short of\nthe runway until this coordination has been completed. You cannot line\nup aircraft without coordination because it is possible to receive an\ninstruction from approach which the aircraft is not able to comply with,\nthis will cause the runway to be blocked. The holding point is the line\nbefore entry the runway which ensure the safety distance between\naircraft. You can also say hold short for an aircraft which will mean\nthat the aircraft will be stopped with the nose perpendicular to the\nrunway. Hold short is used only when you have to wait for other aircraft\nto vacate the runway or only when an aircraft with a small wingspan is\non final. Also, you will receive coordination reports from the Approach\ncontroller where you receive the arrival runway for each aircraft and\nthe estimate time that it is from final, this helps you and the Ground\ncontroller to manage the departing traffic efficiently.\nPriority is different from that of a ground controller. As tower,\npriority is given based on the aircraft's economy. The arrival aircraft\nwhich is on final have priority towards the departing aircraft which is\nwaiting at holding point. You have to be very convinced when you give a\ntake-off clearence when an aircraft is on final, because you can’t risk\na go-around for arriving aircraft. How i say before, economy of the\nairlines is the priority and an aircraft which is waiting at holding\npoint for few minutes will not use more fuel than an aircraft which is\ngoing-around and flying pattern to coming again on approach.\nBeside of runways you also have under control the CTR Otopeni which is\nan airspace with a semicircular shape centered on the airport, with\nsemicircular shape north of the airport because on south is bordering\nwith CTR Baneasa. CTR Otopeni covers ground to 2000ft. As tower, you\nhave to control all VFR flights which are flying in within the Otopeni\nCTR, even if they are not departing or arriving at LROP or at any other\nairfields within the CTR, flying a traffic pattern or just simply\ncrossing the Otopeni CTR. Control of aircraft within the CTR is\nprocedural (in real life radar is used only for orientation) and you\nhave to request and provide further information to the aircraft. You\nhave to request the current squawk code of the aircraft if they are\ndeparting from an airfield other than LROP that are within the CTR (also\nfor Otopeni departures if is unknown) or are just entry in CTR from the\noutside. In normal conditions the pilot should give you his squawk code\non initial contact. For an aircraft flying traffic patterns you can\nrequest that they report the leg of the pattern and also any position\nreport (buildings, waypoints, distance from VORs, etc). For aircraft\nwhich are not flying in the pattern you can request at any time entry\nand exit points, followed route within CTR, estimate times for entry or\nleaving the airspace, altitude, direction of leaving the CTR, speed and\nother information which help you to separate the aircraft. You have to\ninform VFR aircraft about the local QNH and weather/runway conditions.\nYou also have to inform IFR traffic and also VFR traffic about any\naircraft from vicinity mentioning the approximate distance in miles and\nclock direction toward other aircraft. Because the top limit of CTR is\n2000ft and the upper airspace is TMA Bucuresti which is a class A\nairspace where VFR flights are not allowed you have to be sure that VFR\naircraft are not flying above 2000ft until the exit below of TMA\nBucuresti or when they are flying in north of TMA where the bottom limit\nof TMA is 4500ft. When an aircraft leave the CTR Otopeni on south you\nhave to transfer him to Baneasa Tower on 120.800 and if the aircraft\nleave the CTR through a other direction you have to transfer them to\nBucharest FIC (Flight Information Center) because they entry in a class\nG uncontrolled airspace. In normal conditions, the pilot should report\nwhen he exits your airspace.\n\nDuties\nWe take a flight from approaching the holding point to handoff to\nApproach and backward.\nWe supose DLH1CF is flying from Bucharest Henri Coanda to Munich:\n\nPilot: Otopeni Tower, good evening,DLH1CF approaching holding\nrunway 08R.\nATC: DLH1CF, good day, Otopeni Tower, hold short runway 08R,\nreport ready for departure.\nPilot: Hold short 08R, will report ready for departure, DLH1CF.\nPilot: DLH1CF is ready for departure.\nATC: DLH1CF, line-up and wait runway 08R.\nPilot: Line-up 08R, DLH1CF.\nATC: DLH1CF, wind is 060 degress with 5 knots, you are cleared for\ntake-off runway 08R, after departure contact Bucharest Approach on\nfreqfency 118.250, good bye.\nPilot: Copied wind conditions, clear for takeoff runway 08R, after\ndeparture contact Bucharest Approach 118.250, good bye.\n\nNote: You can jump straight to takeoff clearance should traffic permit\nthis, and if coordination with approach is complete. The coordination\nwith Approach is mandatory, as if the Approach gives you any instruction\nfor aircraft after departure you have to tell them before aircraft entry\non the runway (heading, initial climb, etc). After takeoff instruction\nyou can tell to the aircraft to report airborne and after his report to\nhandoff him to Approach. If you don’t tell to aircraft to report\nairborne you can handoff him to Approach like in example listed above,\nor after you are sure if he is airborne. When you hold an aircraft at\nholding point because other is on short final you have to tell to the\nholding aircraft the reason for hold and information about the landing\ntraffic like distance for example (Example:”Hold position 08R, traffic\nshort final 08R, 3 miles”). If is an aircraft departing and other\naircraft approaching holding point you can tell to the second aircraft\nto “hold short runway 08R, (departing traffic)”. If the ahead aircraft\nis rolling you can tell to second aircraft \"behind departing traffic,\nline up and wait runway 08R\". When first aircraft is airborne to give\nthe takeoff clearance to the second aircraft you have to wait for the\nseparation. The minimum separation time is 2 minutes between a LIGHT or\nMEDIUM aircraft taking off behind a HEAVY aircraft and a LIGHT aircraft\ntaking off behind a MEDIUM aircraft to avoid wake turbulence. You can\nread more about wake turbulence separation here. Also, you have to\nensure 4 miles interval between aircraft with the same category, 5 miles\ninterval between aircraft with 1 category difference (MEDIUM before\nLIGHT or HEAVY before MEDIUM) and 6 miles interval between aircraft with\n2 category difference (HEAVY before LIGHT). The moment when you have to\ncoordinate with approach position is when an aircraft is approaching\nholding point. You have to tell to approach the callsign of aircraft and\ndeparture runway and procedure (SID name or radar vectors).\nExample:\n\n\"DLH1CF is ready for departure runway 08R, SOKRU1K departure.\"\n\"DLH1CF is ready for departure runway 08R, vectors.\"\n\nWe supose ROT3VR is flying from Barcelona to Bucharest Henri Coanda:\n\nPilot: Otopeni Tower, good evening, ROT3VR on ILS approach runway\n08R.\nATC: ROT3VR, good evening, Otopeni Tower, wind is 050 with 4\nknots, runway 08R clear to land.\nPilot: Clear to land runway 08R, ROT3VR.\n\nNote: The extract above is the ideal one. When an aircraft is on\napproach his landing clearance is influenced by traffic and weather or\nrunway condition. So if the runway is busy for the moment you have to\ntell to aircraft to continue approach \"ROT3VR, continue approach runway\n08R\". You can also tell him the traffic situation: \"You are number\ntwo/three for landing\" / \"Traffic departing\". When runway is clear for\nhim you can clear him to land using the phraseology from above. Also you\ncan give speed restriction to aircraft on approach to ensure time for\nlanding clearance: \"maintain minimum approach speed\" / \"maintain speed\n140 (or less)\". If the aircraft reach 4 miles from the runway and\nlanding clearance is not possible you have to give a go around to the\naircraft. When an aircraft is go around you have to give him \"maintain\nrunway heading and climb to 4000ft\" then to coordinate with approach to\nsee if he has any initial instruction for him and after that handoff the\naircraft to Approach. If you say to an aircraft \"expect late landing\nclearance\" and the wind condition, in case of impossibility of landing\nclearance, go around can be given until 2 miles from runway. When you\ngive landing clearance you can tell the aircraft which taxiway to vacate\non (\"Vacate on D\") and also you can tell him to report when runway is\nvacated.\n\nATC: ROT3VR, contact Otopeni Ground Control on 121.700, good bye!\nPilot: Contact Otopeni Ground on 121.700, ROT3VR, good bye!\n\nNote: The moment of handoff to ground should be when you see visual the\naircraft which vacate the runway or when pilot announces runway vacated.\nIf you have an aircraft on final waiting for his landing clearance and\nan aircraft report runway vacated, you should give landing clearance\nfirst and then handoff the landed aircraft to the ground controller.\n\n\n\nDate\nChanges\n\n\n\n\n13.03.2016\nInitial release\n\n\n\n"},"training/STUDENT_3.html":{"url":"training/STUDENT_3.html","title":"S3 - Approach Controller","keywords":"","body":"APPROACH CONTROLLER (STUDENT 3)\nPosition overview\nAs the name implies, Approach is responsible that aircraft when they\napproach the airport. For arriving aircraft, the hand over point is\nnormally when the aircraft enters the STAR (Standard Instrument Arrival)\nentry point. Approach is responsible that separation is made in a safe\nway. In case the STAR doesn't end at the initial approach fix (final),\nApproach is responsible for vectoring aircraft on to the final with\nproper altitude and speed. Approach may also vector aircraft away from a\nSTAR or SID (Standard Instrument Departure) if this is necessary for\nsafety reasons, or to get a good traffic flow.\nNormally Approach also handles departure's responsibilities, taking care\nof departing aircraft which are handed over to Center Control. Arriving\naircraft are usually handed over to Tower when they have established ILS\n(Instrument Landing System) or when on final for visual approach.\n\nBucharest Approach have under control TMA Bucuresti airspace which is\nclassified as class A airspace where only IFR flights and SVFR are\npermitted. The vertical limits on TMA Bucuresti are 2000ft-FL175 with\nmention that in north of TMA vertical limits are between 4500ft and\nFL175 because of higher elevation and other activities in that area.\nBelow this limits is class G uncontrolled airspace excluding CTRs which\nare under tower control. In airspace you have to control all IFR flights\nwith are departing or arriving at Otopeni and Baneasa and also flights\nwith just cross the airspace at an altitude between 2000ft/4500ft and\nFL175. Your main objective as approach controller is to maintain the\nseparation between aircraft and to ensure them a safe departure, arrival\non crossing of the airspace and then we can talk about efficiency and\neconomy of the airlines. In all TMAs from Romania the horizontal\nseparation is 5nm and vertical separation 1000ft. You have to find the\npotential conflicts from time and to avoid them before is already too\nlate. The transition altitude is 4000ft and the transition level is set\nby ATC but generally is FL050. Also when the local QNH is greater than\n1013 hPa you should avoid to descending aircraft to FL50 because\nvertical separation between an aircraft at FL050 on standard QNH\n(1013hPa) and an aircraft at 4000ft on local QNH is less than 1000ft.\nBucharest Approach uses the Callsign LROP_APP and transmits on\nfrequency 118.250. It's full radio Callsign is “Bucharest Approach”.\nWhen the main frequency is serviceable it will be used alternative\nposition with Callsign LROP_A_APP transmitting on frequency 120.600\nwith the same radio Callsign: “Bucharest Approach”.\nYou have to handoff aircraft to the tower position when aircraft are\nestablishing on ILS or if is on visual approach when they have runway in\nsight. You also have to know that coordination with tower is mandatory.\nYou should coordinate with tower twice for each aircraft. First time\nwhen an aircraft is entry your airspace mentioning the Callsign of\naircraft, arrival runway and if it is possible estimate time until\nfinal. The second coordination should be when aircraft is established on\nILS or for visual when they have runway in sight, so exactly before\nhandoff to tower position, mentioning that aircraft is on final. The\nhandoff to radar position should be done until aircraft leave your\nairspace on horizontal or vertically. You have to know which radar\nposition you should handoff the aircraft. In real life in low traffic\nsituation sectors NERDI, LOMOS and KOMAN are working like one sector\nonly named KONEL which use the frequency of LOMOS 122.025 and sector\nARGES and DINSI are also working like one sectors which use frequency of\nARGES 121.175. So then you have one sector for aircrafts witch leave\nyour airspace to west and other sectors for aircrafts witch leave your\nsector to east. On VATSIM in most of the time is only one radar position\nwhich cover all radar sectors in Romania and that is LOMOS on 122.025.\nYou also can coordinate anytime with a radar position for any aircraft\nusing the voice/text communication but also electronic coordination\nusing tools from Euroscope.\n\nWhen you log in into Bucharest Approach you should coordinate with Tower\nposition (if is online) to know the active runways and also to select\nthem in Euroscope. The main runways which should be use at Otopeni are\n08L and 08R with are equipped with CAT III ILS approach in case of LVO\nand also ensure a short taxi route for departing the aircraft and a\nshort approach for aircraft with comes from west (the most of them). So\nwhen the wind is calm and also even if is light wind favorable for\nrunway 26L/R (till 6-7kt) you have to use runways 08L/R as active. So in\nmost of the time, in normal conditions, when active runways are 08L/R\nthe both runways are used for arrivals and departures. When active\nrunways are 26L/R is recommended to use runway 26R for departures and\nrunway 26L for arrivals. The active runways can be dependent on local\nrestriction which can be found in NOTAM.\nIn most of the time conventional SIDs and STARs are suspended so only\nRNAV procedures in use. If one aircraft is not able for RNAV he will\nreceive vectors. So if active runway is 08 will be used U arrivals/K\ndepartures and if runway 26 is active will be used X/R arrivals/M\ndepartures.\nBecause this is a radar position all your actions should be focused on\ntag of the aircraft. You have to assume aircraft when they are on your\nfrequency and you have control of them. So when you receive the handoff\npop-up for an aircraft you have to assume the tag only after the pilot\ncontacts you. If an aircraft was just handoff to you and he is not\ncrossing your airspace and should be with other controller you have to\nrefuse the tag immediately and if is necessary to tell to the controller\nto which position should handoff the aircraft. In images below you have\nall necessary explanations for ROMATSA tags.\nTAG Information\n\nThe pink tag mean that aircraft is not in your airspace but will be\nsoon.\n\nThis pink tag with white callsign mean that you recive an handoff from\nother contoller.\n\nThe yellow tag mean that aircraft is assumed by you and you have full\ncontrol for him.\n\nThe yellow tag with pink callsign mean that you initiate a handoff to\nnext contoller.\n\nThe grey tag mean that aircraft is not in your airspace and also he\nwill never cross you airspace.\n\nThe grey tag with squawk code instead of callsign mean that the tag in\nuncorelated.\n\nThe grey line without tag mean that tha aircraft have transponder on\nstandby but is recived by a primary radar.\nThis is the ROMATSA tag's structure:\nCALLSIGNCURENT ALTITUDE - VERTICAL SPEED INDICATOR (UP/DOWN) - CLEARED ALTITUDE\n\nHANDOFF POSITION/POSITION WITCH HAVE TAG ASSUMEDSECTOR EXIT ALTITUDE (USED FOR COORDONATION) - ASTERIX - GROUND SPEEDCLEARED HEADING/DIRECT - CLEARED SPEED\n\nNow we describe the operational mode of ROMATSA tags. When you use\nleft-click on CALLSIGN you open the handoff pop-up menu and\nright-click will show you the drawn route for aircraft. Using left-click\non CURENT ALTITUDE or VERTICAL SPEED INDICATOR and CLEARED\nALTITUDE, if appear, you open the cleared altitude menu. Using\nright-click on CURENT ALTITUDE will show you drawn route with\nexpecting altitude and handoff positions. If the next controller\nposition is not correct you can change it using left-click on position\nindicator. If you use left-click on SECTOR EXIT ALTITUDE, you will\nopen COPX altitude menu where you can coordinate level changes with\nother positions. ASTERIX is operable only on right-click and will\nopen a text box where you can put a way point for direct or any remarks.\nIf you use left-click on CLEARED HEADING, you can set assigned\nheading and if you press right-click you can write a way point for\ndirect. Using left-click on CLEARED SPEED you can set assigned speed\nrestriction in IAS and using right-click you will set assigned speed in\nmach.\nBesides using the tag, you also have to work with “Sector exit list” and\n“Sector inbound list”. These are very useful tools in Euroscope for\noperable radar positions. In Sector inbound list you can see aircraft\nwhich will cross your airspace. The aircraft are ordered by estimate\ntime to entry in your airspace. In “Sector inbound list” you can see for\neach aircraft the Callsign, the position which control the aircraft,\nentry point end estimate time and flight level and also the exit way\npoint and estimate time. From that list you can send electronic\ncoordination for entry points and entry flight level. In “Sector exit\nlist” you can see aircraft which are under your control which are\nordered by cleared flight level to see if you have two aircraft or more\nat the same altitude and prevent a conflict easier. In that list you can\nsee for each aircraft the Callsign, the cleared flight level, exit point\nand estimate time, COPX flight level and for aircraft landing in your\nairspace you have to select the runway and star (if necessary) for\narrival.\nDuties\nWe take a flight from airbone to handoff to ACC position and backward.\nWe supose DLH1CF is flying from Bucharest Henri Coanda to Munich:\n\nPilot: Bucharest Approach, good evening, DLH1CF airbone runway\n08R, passing 2500ft.\nATC: DLH1CF, good day, Bucharest Approach, radar identiefied,\ncontinue SOKRU1K departure, climb FL280.\nPilot: SOKRU1K, climb FL280 DLH1CF.\n\nNote: The upper extract is only an example. From initial contact to\nhandoff to Bucharest Radar you can give anytime radar vectors using\nheading or direct to, to change cleared altitude or to give speed\nrestrictions. You have to do this to ensure a quickly crossover of your\nairspace for aircraft, but in the same time to ensure a safety departure\nor arriving avoiding conflicts between aircraft. In next extract you\nhave used phraseology for radar vectors, altitude change and speed\nchange:\n\nDLH1CF, turn left heading 290.\nDLH1CF, proceed direct SOKRU/turn left direct SOKRU/cleared direct\nSOKRU.\nDLH1CF, climb FL360/stop climb at FL070/continue climb FL280.\nDLH1CF, reduce speed 220kt or less/maintain speed 240kt/no speed\nrestrictions/free speed.\n\nIf in a transmission to pilot you have to give more than one of this\naccording to vectors, altitude and speed clearance you have to respect\nthis order: HAS (heading, altitude, speed). Example: DLH1CF, direct to\nSOKRU, climb FL360, no speed restrictions.\nBecause for aircraft this is first contact with a radar position you\nhave to check if squawk is set corrected and if tag is correlated and\nset to right aircraft and after that to say “radar identified”.\nAlso tower will coordinate with you and will tell you he has an aircraft\nwhich will depart from one runway. You have to respond to him and to\nclear the takeoff. If traffic is not permitting this, you tell to tower\ninstructions after departure for departing aircraft or if the traffic is\nnot permitting at all you tell to tower to wait with takeoff clearance.\nYou also have to know transition altitude. For example, transition\naltitude at Otopeni is 4000ft, when you climb and aircraft to 4000ft is\non altitude and he must be on local QNH but if you want to climb him\nabove he will be on level and will set QNH on STD mode. You don't have\nto announce this to them, as they already should know this.\n\nATC: DLH1CF, contact Bucharest Radar 122.025, have a nice flight,\ngood bye!\nPilot: Bucharest Radar on 122.025, good bye, DLH1CF.\n\nNote: You have to handoff the aircraft to Bucharest Radar before\nreaching FL175 and to ensure some time to contact radar until aircraft\nreach FL175. The best moment to handoff the aircraft to radar is when\nthis pass FL150, but this depend by aircraft performance.\nWe supose ROT3VR is flying from Barcelona to Bucharest Henri Coanda:\n\nPilot: Bucharest Approach, good evening,ROT3VR inbound TOSVI\ndecending FL110.\nATC: ROT3VR, good day, Bucharest Approach, radar contact, follow\nTOSVI2U arrival for ILS approach runway 08R, decend FL070.\nPilot: TOSVI2U arrival for ILS 08R, decend FL070.\n\nNote: This is first contact with the aircraft. You have to check if\naircraft is correlated and appear on radar and to confirm that saying\n“radar contact”. Then you have to give the instruction to the aircraft\nin the following order: HAS (heading, altitude, speed) and also the\narrival runway and type of approach. If you give to aircraft a STAR, you\ntell him arrival runway and approach type just after STAR name and then\ncontinue with altitude to descend and speed restriction if is needed. If\nyou give radar vectors to aircraft tell him “radar vectors\nfor...approach type and runway” at the end of instruction HAS.\nExample:\n\nFollow STAR arrival for approach type and runway, descend x,\nmaintain speed x. - for STAR.\nFly heading x, descend x, maintain speed x, radar vectors for\napproach type and runway - for vectors\n\nAlso here you have to coordination with tower: “Tower, ROT3VR entry at\nTOSVI for ILS08R in about ten minutes on final”\n\nATC: ROT3VR, direct OBELA, decend 4000ft, qnh 1028.\nPilot: Direct to OBELA, decend 4000ft, qnh 1028.\n\nNote: From initial contact to handoff to Otopeni Tower you can give\nanytime radar vectors using heading or direct to, to change cleared\naltitude or to give speed restrictions. You have to ensure a quickly\ncrossing of your airspace by aircraft but also to avoid conflicts\nbetween aircraft. If you want to create a quickly route for aircraft\nusing direct to... and if the aircraft is on STAR, you have to direct\nhim to points which are on STAR route only. If aircraft is on vectors\nyou can direct him to any point in your airspace but also you can use\nheadings. In next extract you have used phraseology for radar vectors,\naltitude change and speed change:\n\nROT3VR, turn right heading 110.\nROT3VR, proceed direct OBELA/turn right direct OBELA/cleared direct\nOBELA.\nROT3VR, turn right/left by 5 degrees.\nROT3VR, descend FL060/stop descend at FL080/continue descend 4000ft.\nROT3VR, reduce speed 220kt or less/maintain speed 240kt/no speed\nrestrictions/free speed.\n\nIf airport is closed or is too busy you can put aircraft in holding. The\nbest way for that is to use standard holding points which you can find\non STAR charts. example: DLH1CF, hold over UVALU.\nIf is a standard holding point is not mandatory to say the side of\nholding, but if you give another way point for holding you have to\nmention this. example: DLH1CF hold over TUTIX on left side. You also can\nmention more information for pilot like: altitude for hold, time to\nhold, etc.\nYou also have to know transition level. For example, if transition level\nis FL050, when you descend and aircraft to FL050 is on level but if you\nwant to descend him below you have to say feet and also to give local\nQNH to aircraft. If the local QNH is greater than 1013 you have to avoid\ndescending aircraft to FL050 because between an aircraft at 4000ft (on\nlocal QNH) and an aircraft at FL050(on standard QNH) is less than 1000ft\nand this means that vertical separation is not ensured.\nAlso you have to coordinate with tower and to tell him for each aircraft\nthe type of approach and the runway you give it and also the time until\nhe is on final. Also you can coordinate again with the tower before\nhandoff and to announce him the aircraft is on final and again the\nrunway. In this mode tower and ground control know how to manage their\ntraffic.\nYou can announce pilot which order number they have for landing.\nExample:\n\nROT3VR you are number two for ILS approach 08R / you are number two\nfor landing. That helps you because pilots know how to adjust speed\nto approach and that help to separation between aircraft.\n\nATC: ROT3VR, decend 2500ft, clear for ILS approach runway 08R.\nPilot: 2500ft, clear ILS 08R.\n\n\n\nNote: The most used type of approach at Otopeni is ILS. The altitude to\nintercept ILS is 2500ft but if the traffic needs can be also 3000ft. To\nintercept localizer correctly you have to bring aircraft to FAP (Final\nApproach Point - Ex: OBELA for 08R) at an angle of 30 degrees by runway\naxe. For example, if an aircraft is coming from North-West for ILS\nrunway 08R he has to come to OBELA on heading 110. It is not a problem\nif this component varies a bit.\nIf aircraft request visual approach vectors you have to vector him to\nthe runway on axe of the runway and ask him to report when have runway\nin sight and then to handoff him to tower. Also for ILS approach you can\nask pilot to report localizer establish or full establish on ILS that\nmeans also localizer and glide slope intercepted. After the aircraft is\nestablish on ILS you have to coordinate with tower: “Tower, ROT3VR is\nestablished on ILS 08R”\n\nATC: ROT3VR, contact Otopeni Tower 120.900, good bye!\nPilot: Otopeni Tower 120.900, good bye!\n\nNote: The moment of handoff to tower should be when aircraft is\nestablishing on ILS or if is a visual approach when he has runway in\nsight. As phraseology you can tell to aircraft “radar services\nterminated” because next position is not a radar one, but this is not\nmandatory.\nEfficient Arrival/Departure within TMA\nIn these images you have some efficient tips for efficient arrivals in\nTMA Bucharest for LROP for runway 08 and 26 in use:\n\n\nThese arriving tips can be used after aircraft follow the STAR until\nthe shortcut point.\nFor departure aircrafts, with exception of POLUN1K departure where you\nhave to wait until aircraft reach FL105, you can proceed them direct to\nTMA exit point just after departure.\nThese efficient arrivals and departure will be used only when traffic is\npermitting.\nProcedural Approach\nProcedural approach services are used at airports which because of radar\nequipment availed are not able to provide a safe radar vectors service.\nIn Romania procedural approach serviced are in use at Bacau(LRBC), Baia\nMare(LRBM), Craiova(LRCV), Iasi (LRIA), Oradea(LROD), Sate Mare(LRSM),\nSibiu(LRSB), Suceava(LRSV), Targu Mures(LRTM) and Tulcea(LRTC). At these\nairports all services, from ground to approach, are provided by the\ntower position which used only a frequency. You will receive the\narriving traffic from radar position inbound the CTR entry point and\ndescending to minimum airway altitude specified on the airport charts.\nThen you have to give to the aircraft the arrival approach procedure and\nalso a STAR if is available and to descend him to minimum approach\naltitude. When aircraft is on arrival procedure you can ask him any time\nabout position, altitude, speed and so on, information which can help\nyou separating aircrafts. After the aircraft report on final (ILS\nestablish/runway in sight) you can provide regular tower and ground\nservices. For departing aircraft, ground and tower services are regular\nand after departure you have to climb aircraft to minimum airway\naltitude which aircraft is following after leaving your airspace and to\nlet him to follow the SID. If is not any SID available, you have to give\nhim runway heading after departure and then when he passes over a safe\naltitude you can proceed him direct to the exit waypoint. To know his\naltitude, you have to ask him or to give instruction like “report\npassing 2000ft”. Also when he reports approaching minimum airway\naltitude you can handoff him to the radar position.

So for\narrival aircrafts the second aircraft will hold at the entry point and\nfor departing aircraft, the takeoff clearance to the second aircraft\nshould be given after first aircraft is handover to radar position.

Separation is applied horizontally, either\nlongitudinally or laterally, and vertically. Vertical separation is\nobtained by asking crews of aircraft to use a standard altimeter (QNH)\nsetting to operate at different flight levels or at different altitudes.\nRequired separation is described as the minimum distance on each axis of\nthe Cartesian system: vertical, longitudinal, and lateral. This is shown\nin the diagram below:\n\nThe Y axis represents longitudinal; the X axis represents lateral and\nthe Z axis represents vertical.\nImportant\n\nTwo aircraft are separated if AT LEAST ONE of these distances is maintained.\nAny two aircraft must fall within one of the separation cases to be properly separated.\n\nIn the case of lateral separation, the minima are declared as a distance\nin nautical miles (NM) and also in terms of angular difference measured\nin degrees. Longitudinal separation is declared in units of time\n(minutes) and also in units of distance (NM, DME distance, RNAV, ADS).\nVertically, the minima are declared in meters and feet or Flight Levels\n(FL).\nDistance between aircraft is measured from the end of the radar plot\nsymbol of the first aircraft and the end of the radar plot of the second\naircraft.\nTrack is the magnetic route of an aircraft.Cruise flight: An aircraft is in cruise flight if it maintains a\nflight level and is on its own navigation.Parallel Offset: Flight on an offset tracking. The reference track\nis considered a respective distance to the right or to the left.Procedural Control (non-radar): Control based exclusively on\nposition reports of crews.Radar Control: Control based on position elements of an aircraft\ndisplayed on a radar screen and where separation is done by maintaining\na specific horizontal distance (longitudinal and/or lateral) between\nradar returns on a screen representing the aircraft positions in the\nairspace.\nAbbreviations\nATCO - Air Traffic Controller OfficerNM - Nautical Miles\nNote\n\nRelative tracks:\nα - the angle between aircraft tracksSS - same route strict - α ≤ 10⁰SA - same route approximate - 10⁰ \n\nMinimum Radar Separation in Area Control\nAircraft flying on the same route, in the same direction, in cruise flight\nThe minimum longitudinal separation between two aircraft flying on\nthe same route, in the same direction, at the same level, in cruise, is\n10 NM when:\n\nThe speed of the aircraft in front is greater or at least equal to\nthe speed of the aircraft behind.\nThe two aircraft are on the same route i.e. angle (α) between tracks\nis between 0° and 20°.\nThe distance between aircraft is measured as in the diagram below:\n\n\n\n\nThe longitudinal separation in cruise flight shall be maintained by\nusing a combination of distance monitoring and speed control. All\nflights shall be checked to ensure that at least 10 NM separation is\nmaintained at all times, using speed control as required to maintain\nthis.\nThe minimum lateral separation between two aircraft flying at the\nsame flight level, in cruise flight, on parallel tracks is 10 NM:\n\nFor two aircraft in cruise flight, on the same track, traveling in the\nsame direction, at the same level, the flying parallel offset should\nbe laterally separated by a minimum of 10 NM:\n\nThis separation may only be used after confirmation from the pilot that\nthe aircraft is properly equipped for parallel offset.\nThe minimum longitudinal separation between two aircraft flying the\nsame route, in the same direction, climbing or descending, at the moment\npassing the occupied flight level, is 10 NM:\n\nAn occupied flight level is one where the Mode C altitude report on\nan aircraft shows it is ±300 feet of the assigned flight level, after 3\nconsecutive radar returns.\nThis separation is only applicable for flights climbing/descending\npassing the flight level occupied by an aircraft maintaining that level.\nThe approval to pass through that level will only be granted after the\naircraft has occupied a level below or above that aircraft (i.e. FL310\nor FL350 in the case above). The ATCO will maintain radar longitudinal\nseparation until the aircraft is properly separated vertically.\nConvergence separation\nThe minimum longitudinal separation of two aircraft flying at the\nsame flight level or in climb/descent at the time passing the occupied\nflight level, on convergent tracks, is 10 NM\n\nThe separation distance is measured relative to the convergence point.\nUsing the diagram above the separation is D2 - D1 (difference between\nthe distances from the convergence point).\nIf longitudinal separation of 10 NM between distances to the convergence\npoint is not established, then the minimum lateral separation of 10\nNM must be established. The lateral distance must be at least 10 NM when\nthe aircraft are already on parallel or convergent tracks.\n\nThe lateral distance is measured between the position of the aircraft in\nfront and the track of the following aircraft (see diagram above).\nDivergent separation\nThe minimum lateral separation of aircraft flying divergent routes,\nafter the aircraft has passed the track intersection point, at the same\nflight level, or in climb/descent at the moment passing the occupied\nflight level, is 5 NM.\nThe distance is measured between the aircraft closer to the divergence\npoint and the track of the other aircraft.\n\nThis separation may only be used after the pilots report maintaining a\nfixed heading.\nThe minimum lateral separation of aircraft flying divergent routes,\nwhen one of the aircraft has passed the tracks intersection point, and\nthe other is flying toward the intersection point, in climb/descent at\nthe time of passing the occupied flight level, is 5 NM.\nThe lateral distance is the distance between the aircraft closest to the\ndivergent point and the track of the other aircraft.\n\nNote\n\nThis separation may only be used after the pilots report maintaining a fixed heading\n\nAircraft on the same route, opposite direction\nFor aircraft flying the same route, at the same flight level or in\nclimb/descent, in opposite directions, before passing the intersection\npoint, non-radar separation is applicable. The non-radar separation for\neach aircraft is 10 minutes from the point of intersection as shown in\nthe diagram below:\n\nAs this separation is not practical in high traffic situations, the ATCO\nhas the duty to seek alternative separation for aircraft looking to\nclimb/descend or provide vectors for a parallel track separation until\nvertical separation is established.\nFor aircraft flying on the same route, in climb/descent, in opposite\ndirections, after it has been observed on the radar screen that the\nplots have passed each other and it is a fact that the plots won't meet\neach other again; the minimum longitudinal separation is 5 NM.\n\nLateral radar separation minima for the time passing occupied flight level\nThe minimum lateral separation for aircraft on the same route, in the\nsame direction, in climb/descent, at the time of passing the occupied\nflight level, is 5 NM. Headings assigned and confirmed by aircraft must\nbe parallel or divergent.\n\nThe minimum lateral separation or aircraft flying on the same route, in\nopposite directions, in climb/descent, at the time of passing the\noccupied flight level, is 5 NM. Headings assigned and confirmed by\naircraft must be parallel or divergent.\n\nVertical separation\nVertical separation with two or more aircraft may be done simultaneously\nin the following cases:\n\nSame route, same direction, if double vertical separation is assured\nand assigns a rate of climb and descent. ATCO must control the\npositions of the aircraft in the vertical plane to respect the\nseparation required.\nSame route, same direction, and the minimum lateral separation of 5\nNM are respected.\nSame route, opposite direction, after passing, if it has been\nobserved on the radar screen that the plots have passed each other\nand it is ensured that the plots will not meet again and the\ndistance between plots is a minimum of 5 NM.\nSame route, opposite direction, and the minimum lateral separation\nof 5 NM are respected.\n\nAircraft in RVSM (Reduced Vertical Separation Minima) airspace are to be\nseparated by a minimum of 1000 feet vertically. Due to the setup of RVSM\nairspace, aircraft flying in the same direction will be separated by a\nminimum of 2000 feet and aircraft flying in opposite directions by a\nminimum of 1000 feet. All aircraft outside of RVSM airspace shall be\nseparated by a minimum of 2000 feet.\nCircle of Intersection\nThe circle of intersection helps to determine if aircraft are on the\nsame route or flying in opposite directions by using the relative tracks\nof the aircraft.\nThe relative track is the difference between tracks of two aircraft and\ndefines the movement of aircraft in the horizontal plane.\n\n\nNote\nSAS = Same route strict \nAAS = Same route approximate \nCA = Sharp convergence \nCN = Normal convergence \nAC = Approximate convergence \nASC = Opposite direction approximate \nSSC = Opposite direction strict\n\nTip\n\nROT 551 is flying on track 350° and BAW 036 is flying on track 300°.\nTherefore, the relative track is: 350° - 300° = 50° [or 300° - 350° = -50°].\nFrom the circle of intersection chart, the two aircraft are normal convergence (CN).\n\n"},"airports/LRAR.html":{"url":"airports/LRAR.html","title":"LRAR","keywords":"","body":"LRAR - Arad Airport\nGeneral\nArad Airport, while being an international one, is not an airport regularly operated by any of the commercial airlines.

This PTT must be different from the one you have already set in AFV to communicate on the frequency. It is also recommended not to use a character key. For example, you can use Alt, Right Ctrl, Ctrl, Shift or Right Shift.\nGo to Settings: Right Click on LINE 1, then left click on EDIT button:\n\n\n\nIn the image above you will notice how the VCCS mini controller looks.

After that you have to press the set PTT and say Go Ahead.\nThe caller will also say their radio call sign, then communicate the message.\nTWR-APP Coordination\nTWR to APP\nNote: All IFR flights shall be coordinated and released by APP Unit before they enter the runway for take-off.\nExemple: The departure traffic is ROT123 and the SID is BUKEL1K\n\nTWR > APP: \"ROT123 BUKEL\"\n\nThe possible answers that can come from the APP:\n\n\"released\": traffic is allowed to take off without restrictions\n\"released on runway heading\": traffic is allowed to take off, with the restriction of maintaining runway heading after take off (TWR Clearance: \"ROT123, when airborne maintain runway heading ...\")\n\"released, FL60\": traffic is allowed to take off, with the restriction of a lower Flight Level or altitude (TWR Clearance: \"ROT123, recleared, climb initial FL60\" - after readback, the rest of the take-off clearance)\n\"stand-by\":  traffic is not allowed to take off; in this case, wait for a call from APP, and if APP does not call after 3 minutes, initiate a new request.\n\nThe called must end the call after the coordination is finished. To do this, the caller must say OUT (to make the other controller aware that you will hang up the call), then press END button to end the call.\nNote: Verbal coordination expires 3 minutes after \"released\". Any delay that occurs on the ground, in the immediate vicinity of the runways and that will delay the take-off must be reported to the APP, if the actual \"release message\" was given.\nAPP to TWR\nNote: APP shall inform TWR about all IFR and VFR (where applicable) traffic which intend to land at the specified aerodrome. The APP > TWR coordination should include the call sign of the traffic, the type of the approach (ILS, VOR, NDB, RNAV, Visual) and the runway.\nExample:\n\nAPP > TWR: \"HYS789 VOR DME runway 09\"\n\nBecause this is an information, TWR is not constrained to respond with a voice message. The caller should terminate the call by saying \"OUT\" and pressing the END button.\nGND to TWR\nGround must inform TWR if an aircraft is taxiing to a holding point any other holding point that is not at the end of the runway:\n\nGND > TWR: \"ROT456 departure from Golf 08R\"\n\n"},"emergencies/handle.html":{"url":"emergencies/handle.html","title":"Intro","keywords":"","body":"How to handle emergency situations on VATSIM?\nAccording to VATSIM Code of Conduct, article B6, emergencies on VATSIM can be denied by ATC and pilot have to disconnect or to cancel the emergency.\nAn example on how to tell the pilot their emergency is denied: Roger, your emergency is not acknowledge.
