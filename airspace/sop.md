Bucharest ACC\
Standard Operative Procedure (10/2021)

> Glossary:

If both sectors use the following indication, standard LoA with other boundary sectors and SOP, the coordination between the sectors are not necessary except for weather cells, congested sectors/airports and aircraft performance limitations.

The transfer of control with other ATC station inside Romanian Airspace will be used the procedure in “pending release”, to avoid additional workload in relation to the transfer of radar identification and separation on a radar track the acceptiong unit should not perform the operation of “label assumed” until it has made two-way contact with the traffic and the other ATC.

> Process Organisation:

The operating segment represents the basic organizational form for the provision of ATS. It is divided into operating positions in function of the workload that normally weighs on the sector itself and in relation to the structure and type of airspace jurisdiction.

The distribution of tasks and tasks between multiple operating positions is to be considered as a technique for sharing the workload, to cope with needs of supply of services to users, according to various operational contingencies.

The dynamics of work, while respecting specific skills possessed by reason of the rating, must be characterized by a strongly integrated with each other compensation of any load imbalances that may occur for each position.

\>Squawk Code Assignment:

ATS Units within Bucharest FIR shall assign Mode A codes in the following series. Mode C shall also be active.

|                      |                           |                   |                 |

\*Squawk code issued only by ACC Unit.

\*\*ICAO Standard squawk code used by VFR flights when other code was not assigned.

\*\*\*Only for military missions and training.

ATS Units within Bucharest FIR shall assign squawk code 1000 only for ModeS capability aircrafts.

> Runway in use

TWR Units shall select the optimal runway in use, considering the wind component on the airport. Wind is reported on AWOS (live) or reported in METARs as the mean direction and the speed.

When winds and traffic permit, the following runways should be used.

> Airspace Classification

Airspace in BUCUREŞTI FIR is classified according to the provisions of the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 923/2012 ("SERA Regulation"). Provisions of each class of airspace are described in the following paragraphs:

(1) **Class A**. IFR flights only are permitted. All flights are provided with air traffic control service and are separated from each other. Continuous air-ground voice communications are required for all flights. All flights shall be subject to ATC clearance. In BUCUREŞTI FIR Airspace Class A comprises:

- TMA BUCUREŞTI.

(2) **Class C**. IFR and VFR flights are permitted. All flights are provided with air traffic control service and IFR flights are separated from other IFR flights and from VFR flights. VFR flights are separated from IFR flights and receive traffic information in respect of other VFR flights and traffic avoidance advice on request. Continuous air-ground voice communications are required for all flights. For VFR flights a speed limitation of 250 kts indicated airspeed (IAS) applies below 3050 M (10000 FT) AMSL, except where approved by the Romanian CAA for aircraft types, which for technical or safety reasons, cannot maintain this speed. All flights shall be subject to ATC clearance. In BUCUREŞTI FIR Airspace Class C comprises:

- all ATS routes;

- all Aerodrome Control Zones (CTR): Arad, Bacău, Baia Mare, Băneasa, Otopeni, Cluj, Constanţa, Craiova, Iaşi, Oradea, Satu Mare, Sibiu, Suceava, Târgu Mureş, Timişoara, Tulcea;

- TMA ARAD, TMA CONSTANŢA, TMA NAPOC;

- Airspace above FL105.

(3) **Class G**. IFR and VFR flights are permitted and receive flight information service if requested. All IFR flights shall be capable of establishing air- ground voice communications. A speed limitation of 250 kts IAS applies to all flights below 3050 M (10000 FT) AMSL, except where approved by the Romanian CAA for aircraft types, which for technical or safety reasons cannot maintain this speed. ATC clearance is not required. In BUCUREŞTI FIR Airspace Class G comprises:

- airspace outside ATS routes;

- all airspace not designated with another class (A, C) or as Restricted Areas.

Air traffic services are provided for the entire territory of BUCUREŞTI FIR. A part of the Bucharest ACC is permanently delegated to Sofia ACC, the border of delegation consists of a polygon, only above FL245, named Sector DF1. The map of cross-border service provision is provided below:

Controllers are required to be familiar with the airspace structure and restrictions existing immediately beyond the area of responsibility. This airspace has been called the Area of Common Interest (ACI). The extent to which that airspace will be described will be determined at the level of development of a particular Letter of Agreement. The description of the ACI is a mandatory element of a Letter of Agreement.

Handoff of communication shall be made at RFL, except for APP units, at least 5 NM prior to the established limit of ACI.

the authorization from VATSIM Romania Director

> APP Sectors

**Arad Approach (LRAR_APP)** is responsible for the traffic into the TMA Classified C from 2500 ft (predominant lower altitude) to FL175. For all lower limits, check LR ENR 6_51, available on AIP ROMANIA.

For traffic inbound Arad Approach from the BUDOP or MOPUG sectors of Bucharest ACC, Bucharest Radar, in the initial moment, will authorize the aircraft to join the STAR as need for the runway in use, then Arad Approach, at own discretion will vector the aircraft to the FAP. Traffic which comes from the Beograd FIR or Budapest FIR will be transferred to Arad Approach according to the LoA signed by both sectors with VATSIM Romania.

It is recommended that inbound traffic respect the ATC Surveillance Minimum Altitude Chart represented above.

Final Approach Handoff\

- LRAR: at minimum of 6 nm from the threshold at runway 09/27

- LRTR: at minimum of 5 nm from the threshold at runway 11/29
